<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
A simple Halloween-themed 2D platformer created for a university assignment.
</p>
<p>
The objective is to collect every pumpkin seed in a level and light the Pumpkin at the end!
</p>
<p>
This was the first project I fully completed, and as the sole programmer, I was responsible for everything from coding the player and gameplay mechanics to optimisation and bug testing. It was an exciting challenge that allowed me to dive deep into game development using Unreal Engine blueprints.
